LOG FILE Format

If a client sent one message, smtpauth-manager store log to file( default: /var/log/smtpauth/stats.log ),

  client:<client 1><tab>connect_time:<connect_time 1><tab>sender:<sender 1><tab>eom_time:<eom_time><tab>recipient:<recipient 1>
  client:<client 2><tab>connect_time:<connect_time 2><tab>sender:<sender 2><tab>eom_time:<eom_time><tab>recipient:<recipient 2.1><tab>recipient:<recipient 2.2>
  sender:<sender 3><tab>client:<client 3><tab>eom_time:<eom_time><tab>recipient:<recipient 3><tab>connect_time:<connect_time 3>
  ...

  <clinet>: Client IP address
  <auth_id>: SMTP AUTH ID
  <sender>: Envelope from mail address( MAIL From: ).
  <recipient>: Envelope recipient address( RCPT To: ).
